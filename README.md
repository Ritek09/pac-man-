# Pac-Man Game Using Pathfinding Algorithms

## Description
This project presents the development of a Pac-Man game using Python and Tkinter. The game includes a graphical user interface, real-time movement, and an AI-controlled ghost system. 

## Features
- **Pac-Man Navigation**: Move Pac-Man through a maze collecting pellets while avoiding ghosts.
- **Multiple Mazes**: Three different mazes with doors allowing Pac-Man to switch between them.
- **AI-Controlled Ghosts**: Ghosts use pathfinding algorithms to chase Pac-Man.
- **Game Ending Conditions**: The game ends if Pac-Man is caught by a ghost or if all pellets are collected.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Pathfinding Algorithms** (for AI-controlled ghost movement)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pacman-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pacman-game
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python pacman.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to move Pac-Man.
- Collect all pellets to win.
- Avoid ghosts or the game will end.
- Use doors to switch between mazes.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more complex AI for ghosts.
- Add power-ups for Pac-Man.
- Enhance graphics and animations.
