#PacMan Game Using PathFinding Algorithms 

This report presents the development of a Pac-Man game using Python and Tkinter. The game includes a graphical user interface, real-time movement, and an AI-controlled ghost system.The aim of this project is to create a simple Pac-Man Game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game will feature Pac-Man navigating through a maze, collecting pellets while avoiding ghosts. The game will include three mazes, and Pac-Man can switch between mazes using doors. The game will end if Pac-Man is caught by any ghost or if all the pellets are collected.
